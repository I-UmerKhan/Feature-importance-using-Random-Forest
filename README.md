# Feature-importance-using-Random-Forest
I learned how to check feature importance in Random Forest using sklearn. This is useful for understanding which features contribute most to the model's predictions, allowing for more informed decisions about feature selection and engineering. By identifying important features, we can simplify the model, improve its performance, and gain insights into the underlying data patterns. This process enhances the model's interpretability and can help in focusing on the most relevant variables for prediction.
